         Optionally provide a time element for each waypoint. Xcode will interpolate movement
         at a rate of speed based on the time elapsed between each waypoint. If you do not provide
         a time element, then Xcode will use a fixed rate of speed.
         
         Waypoints must be sorted by time in ascending order.
